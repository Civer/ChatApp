# ChatApp

This will be a small App for job applications in the future.
It will combine certain technologies to achieve this goal.
Furthermore I will include a developer diary for following along the process.

## Goals:

- Create a chat application.
- Visitors should be able to create accounts.
- After confirming the mail account user is able to log in.
- After logging in the user is able to chat with other users.

## Additional Informations:

- The account data doesn't need to be changed afterwards.
- It is not necessary to have a real time chat.
- No notifications about new messages are needed.

## Personal Challenges:

- Backend and Frontend will be hosted on different technologies (Backend: Node.js / Frontend: Dedicated Webserver (Apache/nginx)).
- Two different databases (One for important userdata (SQL based), one for "unimportant" chat data (NoSQL based)).
- 20h Timeframe spread across one week (starting 18.09.2019 - Time tracking within Toggl)
- Writing a developer diary (After every coding session track write down what you've done, why you've done it the way, what you've learned etc...)

## File Scheme:

- Backend:

Backend has two folders. One for the dev version of the server (whichever it will be at the end) and one for the RTP version (Final).

- Frontend:

Frontend has two folders. One for the dev version of the server (whichever it will be at the end) and one for the RTP version (Final).

- DevDiary:

Folder to give you insight in my thought patterns while developing this small project

- Documentation:

I will try to provide a proper documentation of the project if there is enough time for it.
This will be done with Docusaurus in this folder.
